Wordpress + Postlight install for Asparagus Magazine backend

## Set up

I'm using Local by Flywheel to manage the Wordpress part of the project. You can download it free here
https://localwp.com/
Install and create a new project following prompts. I used all the default options except I changed where the root folder lives on my computer (if you don't change it, it goes into the root directory of your computer. I put it in a Clients2022 folder. Wherever you want it is fine)

To use it you just need to start the site and click the button for opening the admin view. 

## Sharing code

We'll use All-In-One WP Migration to share the database via file as needed. I can slack you the extension.

This is not the full Postlight React starter kit. I just wanted the super simple theme, so downloaded the project and copied just theme into my backend folder
